# Otherworld Tales Components

Welcome to **Otherworld Tales Components** – a curated collection of reusable React components and UI elements extracted from my indie hacker project, Otherworld Tales. A project which aims to help adults get to sleep easier through immersive stories and an easy to use UI. This project powers a Next.js website featuring immersive adult bedtime stories with interactive media, ambient scenes, and engaging user experiences. I’m sharing these components publicly to help other developers build rich, responsive applications.

## Overview

Otherworld Tales is built using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and leverages modern libraries such as Radix UI and Framer Motion for accessible, animated interfaces. In this repository, you’ll find a selection of components including:

- **StoryCard:** A responsive card component to display story details (title, cover art, narrator, etc.).
- **StoryList:** Layout components for displaying stories in grid or list views.
- **StoryPlayer:** An interactive media player for playing audio stories.
- **SceneSelector:** A component to choose immersive visual scenes and control ambience.
- **Queue:** A drag‑and‑drop queue for managing story playback.
- *… and more!*

Each component is designed to be modular, customizable, and easy to integrate into your own projects.
